Getting Database Development Under Control

SQL is code too! Why don’t you have it under source control? There are no more excuses 
with SQL Server Data Tools. SSDT is a project type for Visual Studio that helps you build, 
debug, maintain and refactor databases. You’ll learn how to create a database from scratch 
or import an existing database as your starting point. We’ll demonstrate publishing, 
refactoring and debugging T-SQL and .Net SQL CLR procedures. We’re not just talking about 
tables and procedures either; we are talking about all types of database objects that you 
typically manage in SSMS. Additionally, we’ll look at some often overlooked features of 
Visual Studio for unit testing stored procedures and doing schema and data comparisons.
