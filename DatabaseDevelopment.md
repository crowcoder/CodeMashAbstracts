## Getting Database Development Under Control

SQL is code too! Why donâ€™t you have it under source control? There are no more excuses 
with SQL Server Data Tools. SSDT is a project type for Visual Studio that helps you build, 
debug, maintain and refactor databases. In this session you learn how to create a database from scratch 
or import an existing one as your starting point. Publishing, refactoring and 
debugging T-SQL and .Net SQL CLR procedures are demonstrated. Managed objects are not limited
to tables and procedures; all types of database objects that you typically manage in SSMS 
is discussed. Additionally, some often overlooked features of Visual Studio for unit testing 
stored procedures and running schema and data comparisons is introduced.
