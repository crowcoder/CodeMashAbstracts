## Debug Like It's Your Job

Being a developer is not just about writing code - that code has to work and figuring out why it doesn't
is a different mindset than writing it. Debugging is not a prescibed recipe, it is a necessary 
skill for any developer. While this ability is inevitably gained through experience, there are tips tricks 
and techniques you can learn to level up your effectiveness as a programmer right now. 

For the novice, intern or new-grad, this session takes you through the most common things you don't know yet.

* how to use breakpoints effectively (there's more to it than you think)
* what the heck step into, step over and step out do
* how to view and manipulate runtime state
* how to use your environment's interactive terminal to interrogate your program
* what the *stack* is and how it contains a wealth of information
* the importance of Known Good Values (KGVs)
* being a good investigator

Save yourself all those stackoverflow.com downvotes and "*did you even debug this?*" comments. After this 
session, you will have the credentials to openly ridicule newbies yourself.
