Levelling up your C#

A programming language is more than syntax. Behavior and use are idiomatic; to be effective you need to know the 
nuances of the language. In this session you will learn how to easily avoid some of the most common C# mistakes 
that really make a difference in the quality of your software. Whether you are a junior(ish) developer or you’re 
coming from another language, there are several common things often done incorrectly, or that could be done better. 
Some things you will never do wrong again include:

•	Async/Await basics: possible duplicate of async/await basics
•	HttpClient: Sharing is caring
•	Parameters in ADO.Net: What is your quest? “To seek the index”
•	Exception Handling: Don’t throw the stack out with the bath water
•	By ref Reference Type arguments: I object!
•	IDisposable: Knowing when it’s time to let go
