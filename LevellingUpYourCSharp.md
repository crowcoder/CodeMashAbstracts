## Levelling up your C#

A programming language is more than syntax. Behavior and use are idiomatic; to be effective you need to know the 
nuances of the language. In this session you learn how to easily avoid some of the most common C# mistakes 
that really make a difference in the quality of your software. Whether you are a junior(ish) developer or you’re 
coming from another language, there are several common things often done incorrectly, or that could be done better. 
Some things you will never do wrong again include:

*	Async/Await basics (*possible duplicate of async/await basics*)
  Years after the introduction of async/await there is still much misunderstanding. A few simple concepts and rules
  can keep you out of trouble.
*	HttpClient (*Sharing is caring*)
  We're trained to dispose of resources as soon as we can, but not this time. See how efficiency is gained by the
  proper use of shared HttpClient instances.
*	Parameters in ADO.Net (*What is your quest? “To seek the index”*)
  Clarifying the use of command parameters and explaining why you may have heard to never use AddwithValue().
*	Exception Handling (*Don’t throw the stack out with the bath water*)
  Catching exceptions is a relatively expensive operation that is often done unnecessarily. Gain understanding
  of what is happening when you catch and throw, and know when you don't need to.
*	By ref Reference Type arguments (*I object!*)
  Passing a reference type by ref is a red flag. In your entire career you may never have a legitamate reason
  to do so. Find out why.
*	IDisposable (*Knowing when it’s time to let go*)
  Shedding light on what it means to be Disposable and guidance on when you need to make your types Disposable.
