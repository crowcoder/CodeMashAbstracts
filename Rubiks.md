## Beginners Guide to Solving the Rubik’s Cube
Have you ever wanted to know how to solve the cube? Do you tell people you can solve 3 sides (no you can’t) but 
not the rest? In less than 60 minutes this session teaches you the easiest way to solve the famous 3x3 puzzle. 

Take advantage of my experience slogging through incomplete, poorly written, confusing and even contradictory 
tutorials on the interwebs. Demonstrated is my own hybrid approach mixing novice and so-called intermediate 
techniques that is actually simpler than the absolute beginner methods you find online.

While you are not likely to be able to solve the cube unaided after just one hour, you are clearly introduced to,
and provided instructions for:
*	Solving the first two layers of the cube intuitively – no memorization needed.
* Correctly identifying patterns so you know which algorithms to employ for that third and last layer.

With this training and supplementary reference material, you will be impressing your peers in no time! 
With practice you can reasonably expect solve times averaging 90 seconds. And since the 3x3 is the base for 
solving other configurations, you will be on your way to solving the 2x2, 4x4, NxN and even some downright strange ones.
